Adaptable Security Maturity Assessment and

2.2.Security standardization and SMEs
Despite SMEsâ€™ challenges in security standardization,
27 
there are no information security or cybersecurity stan-
dards available specifically for SMEs.
10 
Barlette and 
Fomin
20 
state that few information security standards 
are theoretically suitable for SMEs, but given the cost, 
the skills needed, and the language issues, it can be 
assumed that there is no method that can help SMEs 
to improve their security. This hasnâ€™t changed in time; 
however, there are guidelines, technical reports, and 
frameworks that can help SMEs in security 
standardization.
28â€“30 
Security standardization produces 
opportunities but also presents challenges for SMEs. The 
Digital SME alliance in corporation with Small Business 
Standards has published an SME Guide
31 
for the imple-
mentation of ISO/IEC 27001 for establishing an infor-
mation security management system. There are 
initiatives of public and private sector actors in different 
countries to help SMEs with cybersecurity. These initia-
tives are in the form of guidelines, frameworks and 
certification schemes. Some examples are as follows: 
Cyber Essentials from the UK,
32 
The Center for Cyber 
Security Belgium SME Guide from Belgium,
33 
Center 
for Internet Security Controls from USA,
34 
and ETSI 
(global),
35 
NIST Small Business Information Security 
from USA,
36 
and Finnish Cyber Security Certificate 
from Finland.
37

2.3.Security maturity assessment
Maturity models in different domains have been devel-
oped and used since they became popular after the 
introduction of the Capability Maturity Model of the 
Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon 
University.
11 
There is abundant research related to 
security maturity modeling.
